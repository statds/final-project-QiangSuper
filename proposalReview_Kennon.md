Some general comments on your proposal:

-Explain what the term "forest cover type" means.  Is it types of tree?  What are the 7 types? [page 1]
-How large is your training dataset compared to your testing dataset? [page 1]
-What methods will you use to evaluate accuracy?  Just a proportion correctly identified?
     Do you have the correct results for your testing dataset? [page 3]

----------
Good amount of data to build a successful predictive model.  This looks like a promising project, I'm interested to see how it turns out.
   Good luck!
